<h1>Europeana Data Model</h1>

To organize its data Europeana uses a complex data model which is called EDM. Detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation and the reader is referred to the extensive <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation">documentation on Europeana website</a>. However, a basic understanding of how the data is described is necessary for implementing the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding.


<h2>Fields</h2>
<p>
Europeana data is organized in records which correspond to cultural heritage objects. Each record is described by a number of fields which contain such information as the title of the object, its creator, the place, persons and concepts related to it. TBD: Provide an Example. 
</p>

<h2>Aggregated Fields</h2>
<p>
Since Europeana aggregates its data from many cultural institutions which use very different systems and methodologies to describe it, it is often the case that the same kind of information is stored in different fields. TBD: Provide an Example. To address this difficulty Europeana has introduced several specialized Aggregated Fields: <i>title, who, what, when, and where</i>. In these fields we gather together information from different record fields in order to make the discovery of objects easier.
</p>

<h2>Facets</h2>
<p>
The number of records that Europeana contains is very big and growing. Therefore we need efficient techniques to allow our end users discovering what they need easily. One of such techniques is faceted indexiing system that classifies each element along multiple dimensions. Besides being useful for searching data on Europeana portal, facets (those are those filters on the left side of a portal page) can also be used by API users. Currently we support the following facets: 
<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Facet</td><td>Description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Media Type</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Language</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>	
</table>
