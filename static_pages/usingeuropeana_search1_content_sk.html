<h1>Searching Europeana</h1>

<p><strong>General Search</strong></p>
<p>Searching the millions of items in Europeana is simple. Just ask yourself who, what, where or when you are interested in and type these words into Europeana's search box. You can try:</p>

<ul class="point">
<li><strong>Who</strong>: Names of actors, authors, architects, artists, choreographers, composers, conductors, dancers, film directors, musicians or photographers.</li>
<li><strong>What</strong>: Words from titles of books, poems, newspapers, paintings, photographs, films or television programmes.</li>
<li><strong>Where</strong>: Names of towns, cities or countries within Europe or around the world.</li>
<li><strong>When</strong>: Dates (e.g. 1945) such as the year you were born in or a famous date in history or a period (e.g. Roman or Medieval).</li>
</ul>
<!--<p>By default, Europeana search results include content generated by users. To exclude this content from your search results, uncheck the box &ldquo;<strong>Include content contributed by users&rdquo;</strong>, located on the bottom left of the page.</p>-->


<p><strong>Specific search</strong></p>
<p>You can also <strong>narrow your search</strong> by using the same key questions:</p>

<ul class="point">
<li>Enter <strong>who:</strong> followed by a name of an actor, author, architect, etc., in the search box and your results will display only items, where the name you are looking for is listed as creator. For example, searching for <a class="fn url" href="http://www.europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=who%3A+vincent+van+gogh" title="Click here to search who: Vincent Van Gogh">who: Vincent van Gogh</a> will narrow your results to van Gogh's works, excluding photographs of the artist or documentaries about him and his work.</li>
<li>Enter <strong>what:</strong> followed by a type or a subject of the items you are interested in and your search results will display only items of the requested type or on the requested subject. For example, searching for <a class="fn url" href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=what%3A+maps" title="Click here to search what: maps">what: maps</a> will narrow your results to maps, or <a class="fn url" href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=what%3A+Art+Nouveau" title="Click here to search what: Art Nouveau">what: Art Nouveau</a> will display artworks, buildings and monuments done in the Art Nouveau style.</li>
<li>Enter <strong>where:</strong> followed by a name of a town, city or country within Europe or around the world, and your search results will display only items which were created, published or depict the place you are searching for.  For example, searching for <a class="fn url" href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=where%3A+Milan" title="Click here to search where: Milan">where: Milan</a> will help you differentiate your search, when you are looking only for objects created or held in Milan, excluding items on writer Milan Kundera from your search results.</li>
<li>Enter <strong>when:</strong> followed by a date (e.g. 1945) or a period (e.g. Roman or Medieval), and your search results will display only items, where the date is listed in the item's date field.  For example, searching for <a class="fn url" href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=when%3A+1984" title="Click here to search when: 1984">when: 1984</a> will help you differentiate your search, when you are looking only for items dated 1984, excluding items that have 1984 in their title or description, like George Orwell's novel.</li>
</ul>
<p>These search functions also have support for different spellings and multi-lingual support. For example, when you search for <a class="fn url" href="http://europeana.eu/portal/search.html?query=where%3A+Milan" title="Click here to search where: Milan">where: Milan</a>, the results will also include items with Milano, Mailand or Milanas listed as their geographic coverage.</p>

<p><strong>Phrase search</strong></p>
<p><strong>Phrase search</strong> is also possible. Just put <strong>quotation marks</strong> (e.g. &quot;art nouveau&quot;) around the phrase you want to find, or type <strong>AND</strong> between the keywords (e.g. art AND nouveau).</p>

<p><strong>Exclude words</strong> by typing <strong>NOT</strong> in capital letters, followed by the word you want to omit (e.g. Auguste NOT Renoir).</p>

<p>Other helpful <strong>search features</strong> in Europeana include:</p>

<li><strong>Spelling suggestions</strong>: Europeana will suggest an alternative spelling, if it seems a mistake has been made (e.g. a search for 'Dirwin' would prompt the suggestion 'Darwin')</li>
