<h1>Results in Europeana</h1>

<p>Europeana divides search results into 4 main categories: text, images, video and sound.</p>
<p>The types of items included in each section are:</p>

<ul class="point">
<li><strong>Texty</strong> <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_text.gif" title="Texts" alt="Texts" />: books, letters, archival papers, dissertations, poems, newspaper articles, facsimiles, manuscripts and music scores.</li>
<li><strong>Obrázky</strong> <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_image.gif" title="Images" alt="Images" />: paintings, drawings, prints, photographs, pictures of museum objects, maps, graphic designs, plans and musical notation</li>
<li><strong>Video</strong> <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_video.gif" title="Video" alt="Video" />: films, news broadcasts and television programmes.
<li><strong>Audio</strong> <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_audio.gif" title="Sound" alt="Sound" />: music and spoken word from cylinders, tapes, discs and radio broadcasts.</li>
<!--<li><strong>3D</strong> <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_3d.gif" title="3D" alt="3D" /></li>-->
</ul>

<p>Results can be displayed as a grid <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_grid.gif" title="Grid view" alt="Grid view" />, on the timeline <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_timeline.gif" title="Timeline view" alt="Timeline view" /> or on a map <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_map.gif" title="Map view" alt="Map view" />. You can also sort search results by media type, language, date, country, provider or rights, using the menu on the left of the results screen.</p>

<p><strong>Further details</strong> of an object can be found by clicking on the item in the results list. To see the item in its fullest available form (i.e. you would like to read the book, view the full size image or watch a video), click on the link under <strong>'View item at'</strong> which you can find below the thumbnail image. This link takes you to the website of the organisation which has provided the item to Europeana.</p>

<p><strong>Individual items</strong></p>
<p>After performing your search, click on the item you want to view. This will take you to the page, where you can find further details on this item.</p>
<ul class="point">
<li><strong>Rights and license information</strong><br />
Below the item's thumbnail image, you can find <strong>rights and license information</strong> for that particular item.<br />
Note: only about 3 million Europeana items currently have clear rights statements. This number is expected to grow as we continue to improve our metadata quality and standards.</li>
<li><strong>Similar content</strong><br />
At the bottom of the object display page, below <strong>'Explore further!'</strong>,you can see <strong>similar content</strong> to the item you are viewing. Up to 10 similar items are displayed in an image carousel.</li>
<li><strong>Translate item's details</strong><br />
If you want to translate item's details into your language, click <strong>'Translate details'</strong> at the top right.  A window appears where you first choose a service for the translation and then the language you want the details translated to. The services will identify the original language automatically so you don't need to specify that.</li>
<li><strong>Search external services</strong><br />
Many values (e.g., <strong>creator, date, type</strong>) in the item's metadata - item's description - are clickable, linking to related search results. If the value is followed by a little triangle, this means that you can also search this value externally. When you click on the triangle, a window appears where you choose the external service you want to use, e.g. Wikipedia, IMDB, Google.  This will take you to the search results generated by this service.</li>
<li><strong>Link to new search results on Europeana</strong><br />
Links in the item's metadata - item's description - that are not followed by a triangle, take you to the search results on Europeana on these particular values. This is a quick way to find content by specific creator, a certain subject or from a specific museum, archive or library.</li>
<li><strong>View item on the provider's site</strong><br />
You can also see the item in its fullest available form (i.e. you would like to read the book, view the full size image or watch a video) by clicking on the link under <strong>'View item at'</strong>, which you can find below the thumbnail image. This link takes you to the website of the organisation which has provided the item to Europeana. You can also see the item in its fullest available form by clicking on the item's thumbnail.</li>

</ul>

<p>In cases where content providers have supplied a large image, you can also click on a magnifying glass icon <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_zoom.gif" title="See full size image" alt="See full size image" /> below the thumbnail image to view the item in its fullest available form along with its rights information and functions for sharing and embedding the object.</p>
