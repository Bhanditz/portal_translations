</ul>

<p>I risultati della ricerca possono essere visualizzati sotto forma di griglia <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_grid.gif" title="Grid view" alt="Grid view" />, on the timeline <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_timeline.gif" title="Timeline view" alt="Timeline view" /> or on a map <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_map.gif" title="Map view" alt="Map view" />. You can also sort search results by media type, language, date, country, provider or rights, using the menu on the left of the results screen.</p>

<p><strong>Maggiori dettagli </strong> of an object can be found by clicking on the item in the results list. To see the item in its fullest available form (i.e. you would like to read the book, view the full size image or watch a video), click on the link under <strong>'View item at'</strong> which you can find below the thumbnail image. This link takes you to the website of the organisation which has provided the item to Europeana.</p>

<p><strong>Individual items</strong></p>
<p>After performing your search, click on the item you want to view. This will take you to the page, where you can find further details on this item.</p>
<ul class="point">
<li><strong>Rights and license information</strong><br />
Below the item's thumbnail image, you can find <strong>rights and license information</strong> for that particular item.<br />
Note: only about 3 million Europeana items currently have clear rights statements. This number is expected to grow as we continue to improve our metadata quality and standards.</li>
<li><strong>Contenuti analoghi</strong><br />
At the bottom of the object display page, below <strong>'Esplora ulteriormente!'</strong>,you can see <strong>contenuti analoghi</strong> to the item you are viewing. Up to 10 similar items are displayed in an image carousel.</li>
<li><strong>Translate item's details</strong><br />
If you want to translate item's details into your language, click <strong>'Traduci i dettagli '</strong> at the top right.  A window appears where you first choose a service for the translation and then the language you want the details translated to. The services will identify the original language automatically so you don't need to specify that.</li>
<li><strong>Cerca servizi esterni</strong><br />
Many values (e.g., <strong>autore, data, tipo</strong>) in the item's metadata - item's description - are clickable, linking to related search results. If the value is followed by a little triangle, this means that you can also search this value externally. When you click on the triangle, a window appears where you choose the external service you want to use, e.g. Wikipedia, IMDB, Google.  This will take you to the search results generated by this service.</li>
<li><strong>Link to new search results on Europeana</strong><br />
Links in the item's metadata - item's description - that are not followed by a triangle, take you to the search results on Europeana on these particular values. This is a quick way to find content by specific creator, a certain subject or from a specific museum, archive or library.</li>
<li><strong>View item on the provider's site</strong><br />
You can also see the item in its fullest available form (i.e. you would like to read the book, view the full size image or watch a video) by clicking on the link under <strong>'View item at'</strong>, which you can find below the thumbnail image. This link takes you to the website of the organisation which has provided the item to Europeana. You can also see the item in its fullest available form by clicking on the item's thumbnail.</li>
