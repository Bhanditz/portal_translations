<h1>Europeana Repository</h1>
<p>
To organize its data Europeana uses a complex data model which is called Europeana Data Model (EDM). A detailed description of EDM is beyond the scope of this documentation: the reader is referred to the extensive <a href="http://pro.europeana.eu/edm-documentation">documentation</a> on Europeana website. However, a basic understanding of the data organization is necessary for implementing the API. The objective of this section is to provide this basic understanding.
</p>

<h3>Fields</h3>
<p>
Europeana data is organized in records which correspond to cultural heritage objects. Each record is described by a number of fields which contain such information as the title of the object, its creator, the place, persons and concepts related to it. <i>TBD: Provide an Example</i>. 
</p>

<h3>Aggregated Fields</h3>
<p>

Europeana aggregates its data from cultural institutions that can use diverse, fine-grained systems and methodologies. As a result, a link between for example an object and a person may be stored in different specialized fields. To provide simpler views on this data, Europeana has introduced several general Aggregated Fields: <i>title</i>, <i>who</i>, <i>what</i>, <i>when</i>, and <i>where</i>. In these fields we gather together information from different record fields in order to make the discovery of objects easier.

<h3>Facets</h3>
<p>
The number of records that Europeana contains is very big and growing. Therefore we need efficient ways to allow our end users discovering what they need easily. One of such techniques is faceted indexing system that classifies each element along multiple dimensions. Besides being useful for searching data on Europeana portal, facets (those are those filters that you see on the left side of a portal page) can also be used by API users. Currently we support the following facets: 

<table class="bordered">
	<tr>
		<th>Facet</th><th>Description</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Media Type</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Language</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>	
	<tr>
		<td>Date</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>		
	<tr>
		<td>Country</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>			
	<tr>
		<td>Copyrights</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>			
	<tr>
		<td>Provider</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>			
	<tr>
		<td>Completness</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>			
	<tr>
		<td>UGC</td><td>TBD</td>
	</tr>			
</table>
