<p>In addition to standard search options, Europeana offers alternative ways to explore and navigate through our millions of objects. You can discover Europe's rich heritage by searching:</p>

<ul class="point">
<li><strong>With curatorial expertise</strong>: Our virtual exhibitions help you discover and learn more about specific themes, e.g. Art Nouveau or musical instruments. With extensive curatorial information that guides you through the themes, the virtual exhibitions are displayed on the image carousel of Europeana's landing page, and can be also found in the '<strong>Razišči</strong>' tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>Through newest content</strong>: See the latest contributions from our partner museums, libraries, archives and audio-visual archives by clicking '<strong>New Content'</strong> in the '<strong>Razišči</strong>' tab at the top of the page.</li>
<li><strong>By provider</strong>: Click '<strong>By Provider</strong>' in the '<strong>Razišči</strong>' tab at the top of the page to browse through the collections from a specific institution and open doors to any museum, library, archive and audio-visual archive that provides content to Europeana.</li>
<li><strong>Through time</strong>: The interactive <a class="fn url" href="timeline.html" title="Click here to visit the Timeline">Časovni trak</a> lets you see items categorised by date. It is split into 3 sections, which can all be moved by clicking and dragging your mouse to browse through Europeana's collection. The top bar lets you quickly jump to the approximate time period you are interested in. Scan more slowly using the bars in the middle and at the bottom of the page. You can also enter a topic in the search box and see objects relating to the search term. For any given search, the Timeline shows the first 1,000 objects.</li>
<li><strong>On a map</strong>: Click on the globe icon <img src="sp/img/usingeuropeana_map.gif" title="Map view" alt="Map view" />, on the search results page, to view your results on a map.  The Europeana hits are shown as purple circles, with the size of the circle indicating the amount of objects on Europeana for the given search in a specific location. As you zoom in, click on a circle to find out the exact number of objects for that location. When you click on the value, you will get a list of items that you can preview and see on Europeana's full-object display page. <br />
Please note that at this stage, we are only exploring the geolocation possibilities. Hence, the results for only <strong>some of the search terms</strong> on Europeana can be now displayed on a map.</li>
