Europeana API allows you to build applications that use the wealth of cultural heritage objects stored in the Europeana repository. The API uses the standard technology of REST calls over HTTP. Responses are returned in the <a title="JSON" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON">JSON</a> format.

If you wish to get straight to the point of the API you can skip the rest of reading, <a title="">register</a>, and proceed directly to the description of API methods: <a href="api-search.html">search</a>, <a href="api-search.html">record</a>, and <a href="api-search.html"> suggestions</a>.
</p>



<h3>Registration</h3>
<p>To start using the API you should register at the <a title="Registration page" href="/portal/api/registration.html">registration page</a>. Upon the registration you will get your individual private authentication key. This key should be used when calling API methods as a special wskey authentication parameter.</p>

<h3>Backward Compatibility</h3>
<p>The current version of the Europeana API (API2) is fully backward compatible with the previous version (API1). However, we encourage developer to switch to new naming of the fields that were used in API2. For more information on the correspondence between the new and the old fields, please see <a title="API1-API2 Mapping" href="/portal/api/api1-api2-mapping.html">API1-API2 Fields Mapping</a></p>

<h3>API Console</h3>
<p>
There is a method for developers to see how Europeana API works and test it for their needs without getting registered - <a title="The API Console" href="/portal/api/console.html">API console</a>. It is an interactive tool that allows filling call parameters in an online form and see both the expected results and the exact format of the call that should be used by the application to get these results. The API console has been built by us for developersâ€™ convenience. You are encouraged to use it and provide us feedback about its usability for the developer community.
