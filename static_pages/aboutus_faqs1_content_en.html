<!--<h3>About Europeana:</h3>

<dt>What is Europeana?</dt>

<dd>Europeana is an Internet portal that acts as an interface to millions of books, paintings, films, museum objects and archival records that have been digitised throughout Europe.<br><br>
Around 1500 institutions have contributed to Europeana. Renowned names such as the <strong>British Library</strong> in London, the  <strong>Rijksmuseum</strong> in Amsterdam and the Louvre in Paris are featured alongside smaller organisations across Europe. Together, their assembled collections allow you to explore Europe's history from ancient times to the modern day.</dd>

<dt>How does Europeana relate to initiatives such as Google Books?</dt>

<dd>Europeana is a cultural project and not a commercial undertaking. Europeana also has a broader remit than a service such as Google Book Search. Europeana gives access to different types of content from various cultural institutions. This makes it possible to bring together the works of a painter with, for example, relevant archival documents and books written about the artist's life.
</dd>

<dt>How does Europeana relate to The European Library?</dt>
<dd>Europeana and the projects contributing content to Europeana.eu have been funded by the European Commission under eContentplus, the Information and Communications Technologies Policy Support Programme (ICT PSP) and similar programmes. In order to participate in a wide range of projects, which are only funded by the Commission for 50-100% of the costs and do not include overheads, Europeana is also reliant for an element of its funding on Member States' ministries of culture and education.</dd>

<dt>What is the organisational structure of Europeana?</dt>

<dd>The Europeana Foundation is the governing body of the Europeana service. A legal entity under Dutch law, Stichting Europeana comprises the heads of international associations responsible for cultural heritage. The Foundation comprises an Executive Committee, a Board of Participants, and the Council of Content Providers and Aggregators.</dd>-->

<h3>Content on Europeana:</h3>

<dt>Who decides if an item appears on Europeana?</dt>
<dd>The institution that holds the material - individual libraries, audiovisual collections, archives and museums decides what to digitise, based on several criteria:
<ul>
<li>What are the most beautiful, historic or highly regarded items that they are most keen to share with the world?</li>
<li>What do users most often want to consult or view?</li>
<li>Are there hidden treasures little-known items that could be enormously attractive to users once digitised?</li>
<li>Are items too fragile for users to consult, or to be displayed? Digitisation can help both preserve material and make it accessible to users.</li>
</ul>
Once an item is digitised, it can be submitted to Europeana.
</dd>


<dt>Can I see items in a bigger size?</dt> 

<dd>In many cases, you can see bigger versions of items on Europeana simply by clicking on the thumbnail. The available size of the item is decided by the institutions that provide content to Europeana. 
</dd>

<dt>Can I download files such as eBooks, music and films from Europeana?</dt>
<dd>You cannot download items directly from Europeana.eu but we connect you to the original source of the item on the provider's website, where you may be able to download the object. The availability of an item for download depends on the facilities provided by each institution.</dd>

<dt>An item has been incorrectly labelled. What should I do?</dt>
<dd>Details of items in Europeana are provided by the institution holding the original content. <a class="email" href="mailto:content@europeana.eu?subject=Incorrectly%20labelled%20item" title="Click here to email us with the item that you believe has been incorrectly labelled">Email us</a> the details that you believe to be incorrect, and we will pass your information to the content provider.</dd>

<dt>Why can't I find the material I'm looking for?</dt>
<dd>Europeana is expanding all the time. If you are not able to find what you are looking for at the moment, please come back another time to see if it has been added to the database. There are many reasons why a work may not be listed in Europeana:
<ul>
<li>The object has not been digitised</li>
<li>The institution that holds the work is not a Europeana partner</li>
<li>Copyright clearance is needed.</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Why isn't everything on Europeana translated into my language?</dt>
<dd>We work continuously on issues surrounding multilingualism.<br>
With the help of our partner institutions, Europeana's interface is translated into all the official languages of the European Union, and several other languages. Our <a rel="me" class="fn url" href="http://exhibitions.europeana.eu" title="Click here to visit our virtual exhibitions area">virtual exhibitions</a> are also available in different languages.<br><br>
At the same time, we are also working on enabling cross-language searches.  This means, for example, that when you search for &quot;treaty&quot;, your search results will also include &quot;traite&quot;, &quot;trattato&quot;, &quot;traktat&quot; etc.  Currently we have multilingual support for some search functions, but in the years to come, the application of semantic technologies will further advance multilingual search possibilities. <br><br>
We have also enabled a translation function on the portal to help you translate item's details into your language. More information about the search and translation functions is available on our <a class="fn url" href="usingeuropeana.html" title="Click here to get more information on how to use Europeana">Help</a> pages.<br><br>
Although we are doing our best, there is still a need to have more content and information available in a wider range of languages. However, we have to balance our limited resources with other priorities, including adding more content to Europeana and improving the technical function of the site.</dd>
